## Source Inspiration

The colors are extracted from the "From the Desk of Anthony Pompliano" branding image:
- **Background**: Rich, saturated royal blue (#1E4A7C)
- **Text/Accent**: Warm golden yellow (#D4A649)
- **Border**: Ornate gold chain decorative pattern

This creates a more **vibrant, authoritative, and premium** feel compared to the previous darker navy theme.

## Visual Impact

### Before (Dark Navy)
- Very dark, almost black backgrounds
- Subtle and understated
- More "tech startup" vibe
- Lower saturation overall

### After (Royal Blue)
- Brighter, more saturated blue
- **Bold and confident**
- More "established brand" feel
- Better matches official "From the Desk" branding
- **Warmer gold** accent creates better contrast
