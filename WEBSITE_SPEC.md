---

## Mini ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)

### ADR-1: Blog/Articles Section

**Decision**: Link to external content, no embedded blog

**Rationale**:
- **Complexity**: Maintaining blog on main landing page adds content management burden
- **Focus**: Landing page should drive to primary conversions (newsletter, podcast)
- **SEO**: Pomp Letter and podcast platforms already handle content discovery
- **Recommendation**: Include "Latest Content" preview section with links to Pomp Letter archives, recent podcast episodes (external links)

**Implementation**:
- Small "Latest Insights" section with 3-4 cards linking to external content
- Each card: headline, date, source (Pomp Letter/Podcast), external link
- Keeps page simple while showing active content creation

---

### ADR-2: Investment Firms Prominence

**Decision**: Balanced presentation, secondary to media properties

**Rationale**:
- **Audience**: Primary audience is newsletter/podcast followers (consumers), not investment clients
- **Funnel**: Investment clients typically come through credibility built via media
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Position after podcast/newsletter, before book
- **Tone**: Present professionally but not as primary CTAs

**Implementation**:
- Dedicated section with equal space for PCM and Pomp Crypto
- Clean, professional cards with brief descriptions
- "Learn More" links to dedicated sites (not aggressive CTAs)
- Include AUM or other credibility metrics

---

### ADR-3: Interactive Elements

**Decision**: Traditional scrolling with smooth animations, no complex interactive elements

**Rationale**:
- **Brand Alignment**: Pomp's brand is straightforward, confident, no-nonsense
- **Mobile Experience**: Complex interactions (like grid navigation) often degrade on mobile
- **Performance**: Smooth scroll animations feel premium without loading overhead
- **Accessibility**: Traditional scroll is universally understood and accessible

**Implementation**:
- Smooth scroll between sections
- Fade-in animations on scroll
- Sticky header with section jump links (optional, see ADR-8)
- Hover effects on CTAs and cards
- No parallax, no complex JavaScript interactions

---

### ADR-4: Portfolio Showcase

**Decision**: No detailed portfolio showcase

**Rationale**:
- **Scope Creep**: Portfolio pages require significant content and maintenance
- **Privacy**: Many investments may be private or sensitive
- **Purpose**: This site is about personal brand, not investment track record
- **Alternative**: If needed, brief mention in investment firms section with link to ProCap/PCM sites

**Implementation**:
- No dedicated portfolio section
- Investment firms section can mention "portfolio of X+ companies"
- Link to external sites for detailed portfolio (if they exist)

---

### ADR-5: Video Content

**Decision**: Links to YouTube, no embedded videos

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Embedded videos (especially multiple) significantly impact page load time
- **Mobile Data**: Autoplay videos consume data, frustrate mobile users
- **CTA Competition**: Embedded videos compete with primary CTAs
- **Platform Benefits**: Driving to YouTube increases subscribers, watch time on platform

**Implementation**:
- Podcast section includes thumbnail/link to recent episode on YouTube
- "Watch on YouTube" CTA with YouTube branding
- Possible: Placeholder image with play button overlay that links to YouTube

---

### ADR-6: Resources Section

**Decision**: No dedicated resources section, integrate into newsletter CTA

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Each additional section dilutes focus on primary conversions
- **Content Vehicle**: Resources are better delivered via newsletter (drives signups)
- **Maintenance**: Resource lists require updates; better suited for newsletter archives

**Implementation**:
- Newsletter section copy emphasizes "daily insights" and "Bitcoin education"
- No separate resources section
- If resources are critical, consider post-launch addition after analytics review

---

### ADR-7: Testimonials

**Decision**: Minimal testimonials, integrated into relevant sections

**Rationale**:
- **Social Proof Type**: Metrics (downloads, subscribers) are stronger for Pomp than testimonials
- **Credibility**: Guest headshots (podcast) show credibility through association
- **Visual Clutter**: Dedicated testimonial sections often feel salesy

**Implementation**:
- Single testimonial in newsletter section (from subscriber)
- Podcast guest headshots serve as implicit testimonials
- Book section shows ratings/reviews metric, not full testimonials

---

### ADR-8: Navigation

**Decision**: Sticky header with minimal section links

**Rationale**:
- **Usability**: Users expect ability to jump to sections on long scroll pages
- **Conversion**: Easy navigation increases time on page, reduces bounce
- **Mobile**: Sticky nav on mobile can be hamburger menu to save space
- **Compromise**: Sticky nav doesn't prevent smooth scroll experience

**Implementation**:
- Sticky header: [Logo/Name] [Podcast] [Newsletter] [Investments] [Book] [Contact] [Primary CTA Button]
- Desktop: Full horizontal nav
- Mobile: Hamburger menu
- Smooth scroll to sections on click
- Active section highlighting in nav (optional enhancement)

---
